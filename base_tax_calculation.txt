BASELINE TAX CALCULATION
==================================================

To calculate Victor Samuel Patel's tax liability, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down each component step by step. 

### 1. Total Income Calculation from All Sources

**Business Income:**
- Business Income: $248,600

**Other Sources of Income:**
- Dividends: $5,200
- Rental Income: $2,800
- Bank Interest: $1,100

**Total Other Income:**
\[
\text{Total Other Income} = \text{Dividends} + \text{Rental Income} + \text{Bank Interest} = 5,200 + 2,800 + 1,100 = 9,100
\]

**Total Income:**
\[
\text{Total Income} = \text{Business Income} + \text{Total Other Income} = 248,600 + 9,100 = 257,700
\]

### 2. Business Expenses and Deductions

**Business Expenses:**
- Ads: $8,700
- Software: $9,200
- Hardware: $6,800
- Travel: $4,500
- Insurance: $3,900
- Subcontractors: $28,200

**Total Business Expenses:**
\[
\text{Total Business Expenses} = 8,700 + 9,200 + 6,800 + 4,500 + 3,900 + 28,200 = 61,300
\]

### 3. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

**AGI Calculation:**
\[
\text{AGI} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Business Expenses} = 257,700 - 61,300 = 196,400
\]

### 4. Federal Income Tax Calculation with Tax Brackets

For the tax year 2023, the federal income tax brackets for married filing jointly are as follows:

- 10% on income up to $22,000
- 12% on income over $22,000 up to $89,450
- 22% on income over $89,450 up to $190,750
- 24% on income over $190,750 up to $364,200

**Tax Calculation:**
1. **10% Bracket:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 22,000 \times 0.10 = 2,200
   \]

2. **12% Bracket:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = (89,450 - 22,000) \times 0.12 = 67,450 \times 0.12 = 8,094
   \]

3. **22% Bracket:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = (190,750 - 89,450) \times 0.22 = 101,300 \times 0.22 = 22,286
   \]

4. **24% Bracket:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = (196,400 - 190,750) \times 0.24 = 5,650 \times 0.24 = 1,356
   \]

**Total Federal Tax:**
\[
\text{Total Federal Tax} = 2,200 + 8,094 + 22,286 + 1,356 = 33,936
\]

### 5. State Tax Calculation (Texas)

Texas does not have a state income tax, so:
\[
\text{State Tax} = 0
\]

### 6. FICA Taxes (Social Security and Medicare)

**FICA Taxes:**
- Social Security Tax: 6.2% on income up to $160,200
- Medicare Tax: 1.45% on all income

**Calculating FICA Taxes:**
1. **Social Security Tax:**
   \[
   \text{Social Security Tax} = 160,200 \times 0.062 = 9,932.40
   \]

2. **Medicare Tax:**
   \[
   \text{Medicare Tax} = 196,400 \times 0.0145 = 2,851.80
   \]

**Total FICA Taxes:**
\[
\text{Total FICA Taxes} = 9,932.40 + 2,851.80 = 12,784.20
\]

### 7. Total Tax Liability

**Total Tax Liability:**
\[
\text{Total Tax Liability} = \text{Total Federal Tax} + \text{State Tax} + \text{Total FICA Taxes} = 33,936 + 0 + 12,784.20 = 46,720.20
\]

### 8. Effective Tax Rate

**Effective Tax Rate Calculation:**
\[
\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Tax Liability}}{\text{AGI}} \times 100 = \frac{46,720.20}{196,400} \times 100 \approx 23.75\%
\]

### Summary of Tax Calculation

1. **Total Income:** $257,700
2. **Total Business Expenses:** $61,300
3. **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):** $196,400
4. **Total Federal Tax:** $33,936
